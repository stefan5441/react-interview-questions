## JS Questions
Q1: What is hoising in JS?
A1: The process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.  
Example:  
```
printHelloWorld();

function printHelloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}
```
This works in JavaScript cause the declaration of the function is automatically moved on top of the block and that's why printHelloWorld(); is executed without an error.
